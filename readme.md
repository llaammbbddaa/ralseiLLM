# RALSEI AI CLI TOOL
<br>*tool is a strong word, this has no practical use*<br>
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llaammbbddaa/ralseiLLM/refs/heads/master/assets/ralseiGitMD.png)

uses an altered version of a lightweight ollama llama llm that is passed through the cli interface to "mirror" the deltarune chat boxes
<br>
the "personality" is from a scraped set of pages from the deltarune wiki, and sort of acts as a not good RAG
