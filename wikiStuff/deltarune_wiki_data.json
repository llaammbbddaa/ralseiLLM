Feeling undervalued, Susie leaves Kris and Ralsei for a time and teams up with Lancer. Susie's friendship with Lancer helps her become more compassionate.

From here, Susie questions how Ralsei can't be real when she can hear him and see him. Before they can get much deeper into it, they are interrupted by Tenna, who welcomes them to TV World.

However, before it can start, Susie realizes after overhearing Tenna that he's hiding something from them, and refuses to do another round until they figure it out. Investigating a door that had been barred by one of Tenna's henchmen, they discover Toriel outside of the studio in the frozen wasteland. Before they can rescue her though, they are discovered by Tenna who forces them into a final board against their will. The charm of the games has died out and begins to show how desperate Tenna is, how much he craves attention, and how he is afraid of \"The family fighting again\". After a few battles, the Fun Gang manage to get away and explore the wider TV World, and even encountering a fun Cowboy Game in the process. As they wander through TV World, they cause mayhem, initiating a mass walkout by Tenna's employees, that leaves his studio abandoned, and cause Lanino and Elnina to split from Rouxls and return to their own previous relationship. Eventually, getting back to the TV Time Studio, they find it empty and cold, much of the remaining Darkners of TV World slowly turning to stone due to their actions. Entering in, they head back toward where they found Toriel before, only to encounter Tenna again, who eventually explains why he wants to play games so badly, referencing Kris' homelife, the subtle quarrel with the Dreemurrs and the Holidays, as well as the break-up of Asgore and Toriel. He says he used to be watched all the time and is now abandoned. He says that the Roaring Knight appeared, and told him that if he followed their orders, he would never be unwatched again. When he then tries to force them into a new round, Susie refuses, causing Tenna to initiate a battle with the Fun Gang. But after a short battle, he is defeated, and proceeds to admit that he just doesn't want to be thrown away. Ralsei tries to get him to accept it for peace of mind that he, like all Darkners, will become obsolete. But Susie pushes past Ralsei and informs Tenna that it doesn't have to be that way. She tells him that she also knows what it's like to be thrown away, and explains how she found Kris and Ralsei, and found a place to belong, and that he will to."

The player emotionally manipulates Noelle to freeze enemies and solve puzzles by herself and makes a deal with Spamton to acquire a ring that improves her magic. She is eventually forced to freeze Berdly solid with the SnowGrave spell after he confronts the duo. She then leaves Kris, shaken by her own actions, and is too exhausted to participate in Queen's plans. Ralsei informs the latter of the Roaring preemptively, avoiding her battle. Kris goes to seal the Fountain alone but is stopped by Spamton, who upgraded himself into Spamton NEO while Queen was looking for Berdly. Fighting Spamton, Kris calls for help from Susie and Ralsei, who do not respond. The player then calls for help from Noelle, who freezes Spamton. Kris seals the fountain. In the Light World, Berdly is found unresponsive, and Noelle may question whether the Dark World really was a dream if visited at the Hospital. The route ends the same way as the normal route, with Kris opening a Dark Fountain."

        "content": "Chapter 4 however continues the Weird Route through various scenes. At the church, Kris can speak with various characters, including Noelle who seems to desire to have a private conversation with Kris later. After explaining everything they learned about the shelter to Susie, Kris and Susie are interrupted by Noelle who seems interested in having Kris and Susie over for a study session. When Susie wishes to celebrate their lucky break with a high-five, Kris leaves them hanging due to being too interested in Noelle, to which Susie mentions how much things seem to have taken a \"weird route\" for Noelle to ask them like that. After church, Kris and Susie can optionally choose to visit Berdly in the hospital, to which only Kris wishes to go into his room. When in there, Kris finds an unconscious Berdly which they can choose to either leave alone, or warm up by interacting with the space heater and changing his hot water bottle. Doing so shows that Berdly relaxes, and insinuates he might be feeling a little better. When exiting the room, Susie asks Kris to be sure he didn't give them the \"Bird Flu\". After getting to the Holiday Household, everything Proceeds as usual until Kris sets off to investigate December's guitar. At that time, Noelle corners Kris in the upstairs, causing Kris, who had just previously pulled their SOUL out to hide it in the nearest drawer as Noelle says they want to speak with them privately in her room. After Noelle is gone, Kris hurries down stairs to shove the heart in a giftbox until the conversation is over. However, the SOUL escapes by venting out of the room. Traveling through the house's air vents, the SOUL eventually makes its way to Noelle's room to eavesdrop on their conversation. Noelle begins the conversation by rehashing something Kris did without the Player's presence the night before, after sealing the Cyber World Dark Fountain. Noelle said that Kris visited them after taking Berdly to the hospital and that they comforted Noelle by telling her that it was all a silly prank. But when Noelle asks Kris if it's okay if they say something, the player is given the option to tell her too \"Proceed\". Now in the room, the SOUL can join with Kris again. If the SOUL does not join with Kris quick enough, Kris will escape the room with Noelle, causing the Weird Route to be aborted. If the SOUL joins with Kris, as Noelle is trying to mention the things they told her not to mention to anyone else, Kris covers her mouth. When Noelle asks who they're afraid will hear, the Player may then assert it's presence by selecting \"Me\". From here, the Player forces Kris to draw closer to Noelle, reading the girl's mind, and basically chanting \"Proceed\". The Player may then \"Equip\" Noelle with the thorn representing the Thorn Ring, resulting in an image like broken glass glowing red with the SOUL's power. After this, a distraught and enraged Kris will take the SOUL to the bathroom and shove it in the trashcan before electing to kick the can and harm the SOUL, even at their own expense, only stopping when Asgore, who is visiting the house to help clean it, calls in and asks if they're okay. After this, leaving the Holiday Residence, Asgore gives Kris some hot-chocolate he pilfered from the Holidays. Heading out through Hometown, Susie mentions how upset she is that they didn't get to hang out with Noelle, and felt something strange when Noelle mentioned she wanted to talk to Kris alone, asking what they could talk about that Susie couldn't be included in. The SOUL is given no dialogue options, yet a choice in an empty box. Oddly enough, it stops raining and becomes sunny only during this empty choice, and Susie assumes it didn't have anything to do with her. After this, there's less references to the Weird Route, at least while in the Sanctuary Dark Worlds. When Susie leaves to collect information about the notes to be played on the piano, Ralsei asks if Kris would like to think about what Susie's doing. If the Player refuses to think about her, an option is given to think about Noelle. When doing so, the Player views a small red pixel that, after floating and slightly glowing for a moment, says \"Thank you...\" in Noelle's voice. Upon returning to Kris, the Player finds Kris on the ground, likely having had a panic attack, Susie tending to them. Susie notices Ralsei wasn't there and scolds him upon returning. When Kris is confronted by the Old Man, asking them where to go, Kris can respond \"Nowhere\" to which he will mention that it sounds like they're having \"Relationship Trouble\". During the tea party, the Old Man will mention how Kris seems to just be going through the motions, and tries to help them keep their chin up, telling them that it'll all be better, before offering Kris an apple which they ravenously devour, even part of the core. After sealing the first Dark Fountain, when searching for the combination to the lock on the door to the inner sanctuary, they find a shelf for prayer candles. Susie asks who Kris will pray for as they light a candle, and if the Player chooses \"Noelle\", Kris will kick the shelf violently. Later, when in the Choir chamber, Susie mentions about the piano and a story she had with one. Susie asks if Kris will keep playing the piano, and if the Player chooses \"I will never play again\", Kris will bite their own hand to stop the Player's words. In the Final Dark World, after Susie discovers and shatters the final prophecy, Ralsei breaks down into tears. If the Player tells Ralsei \"It's okay not to smile\", Ralsei will mention that if there is another path besides the one they're on, that it could possibly be worse. Finally, as the night comes to an end, the Fountains are sealed, and Kris returns home to find their mother dancing with Sans, Kris decides to go to bed early when they're called by Mayor Carol, who leaves a message, asking if Kris is going to the festival tomorrow, as Noelle really is looking forward to seeing them there. As the chapter comes to a close, we see an image of that once small, red pixel, having become far larger by comparison..."

Investigating a door that had been barred by one of Tenna's henchmen, they discover Toriel outside of the studio in the frozen wasteland. Before they can rescue her though, they are discovered by Tenna who forces them into a final board against their will. The charm of the games has died out and begins to show how desperate Tenna is, how much he craves attention, and how he is afraid of \"The family fighting again\". After a few battles, the Fun Gang manage to get away and explore the wider TV World, and even encountering a fun Cowboy Game in the process. As they wander through TV World, they cause mayhem, initiating a mass walkout by Tenna's employees, that leaves his studio abandoned, and cause Lanino and Elnina to split from Rouxls and return to their own previous relationship. Eventually, getting back to the TV Time Studio, they find it empty and cold, much of the remaining Darkners of TV World slowly turning to stone due to their actions. Entering in, they head back toward where they found Toriel before, only to encounter Tenna again, who eventually explains why he wants to play games so badly, referencing Kris' homelife, the subtle quarrel with the Dreemurrs and the Holidays, as well as the break-up of Asgore and Toriel. He says he used to be watched all the time and is now abandoned. He says that the Roaring Knight appeared, and told him that if he followed their orders, he would never be unwatched again. When he then tries to force them into a new round, Susie refuses, causing Tenna to initiate a battle with the Fun Gang. But after a short battle, he is defeated, and proceeds to admit that he just doesn't want to be thrown away. Ralsei tries to get him to accept it for peace of mind that he, like all Darkners, will become obsolete. But Susie pushes past Ralsei and informs Tenna that it doesn't have to be that way. She tells him that she also knows what it's like to be thrown away, and explains how she found Kris and Ralsei, and found a place to belong, and that he will to."

Doing so shows that Berdly relaxes, and insinuates he might be feeling a little better. When exiting the room, Susie asks Kris to be sure he didn't give them the \"Bird Flu\". After getting to the Holiday Household, everything Proceeds as usual until Kris sets off to investigate December's guitar. At that time, Noelle corners Kris in the upstairs, causing Kris, who had just previously pulled their SOUL out to hide it in the nearest drawer as Noelle says they want to speak with them privately in her room. After Noelle is gone, Kris hurries down stairs to shove the heart in a giftbox until the conversation is over. However, the SOUL escapes by venting out of the room. Traveling through the house's air vents, the SOUL eventually makes its way to Noelle's room to eavesdrop on their conversation. Noelle begins the conversation by rehashing something Kris did without the Player's presence the night before, after sealing the Cyber World Dark Fountain. Noelle said that Kris visited them after taking Berdly to the hospital and that they comforted Noelle by telling her that it was all a silly prank. But when Noelle asks Kris if it's okay if they say something, the player is given the option to tell her too \"Proceed\". Now in the room, the SOUL can join with Kris again. If the SOUL does not join with Kris quick enough, Kris will escape the room with Noelle, causing the Weird Route to be aborted. If the SOUL joins with Kris, as Noelle is trying to mention the things they told her not to mention to anyone else, Kris covers her mouth. When Noelle asks who they're afraid will hear, the Player may then assert it's presence by selecting \"Me\". From here, the Player forces Kris to draw closer to Noelle, reading the girl's mind, and basically chanting \"Proceed\". The Player may then \"Equip\" Noelle with the thorn representing the Thorn Ring, resulting in an image like broken glass glowing red with the SOUL's power. After this, a distraught and enraged Kris will take the SOUL to the bathroom and shove it in the trashcan before electing to kick the can and harm the SOUL, even at their own expense, only stopping when Asgore, who is visiting the house to help clean it, calls in and asks if they're okay. After this, leaving the Holiday Residence, Asgore gives Kris some hot-chocolate he pilfered from the Holidays. Heading out through Hometown, Susie mentions how upset she is that they didn't get to hang out with Noelle, and felt something strange when Noelle mentioned she wanted to talk to Kris alone, asking what they could talk about that Susie couldn't be included in. The SOUL is given no dialogue options, yet a choice in an empty box. Oddly enough, it stops raining and becomes sunny only during this empty choice, and Susie assumes it didn't have anything to do with her. After this, there's less references to the Weird Route, at least while in the Sanctuary Dark Worlds. When Susie leaves to collect information about the notes to be played on the piano, Ralsei asks if Kris would like to think about what Susie's doing. If the Player refuses to think about her, an option is given to think about Noelle. When doing so, the Player views a small red pixel that, after floating and slightly glowing for a moment, says \"Thank you...\" in Noelle's voice. Upon returning to Kris, the Player finds Kris on the ground, likely having had a panic attack, Susie tending to them. Susie notices Ralsei wasn't there and scolds him upon returning. When Kris is confronted by the Old Man, asking them where to go, Kris can respond \"Nowhere\" to which he will mention that it sounds like they're having \"Relationship Trouble\". During the tea party, the Old Man will mention how Kris seems to just be going through the motions, and tries to help them keep their chin up, telling them that it'll all be better, before offering Kris an apple which they ravenously devour, even part of the core. After sealing the first Dark Fountain, when searching for the combination to the lock on the door to the inner sanctuary, they find a shelf for prayer candles. Susie asks who Kris will pray for as they light a candle, and if the Player chooses \"Noelle\", Kris will kick the shelf violently. Later, when in the Choir chamber, Susie mentions about the piano and a story she had with one. Susie asks if Kris will keep playing the piano, and if the Player chooses \"I will never play again\", Kris will bite their own hand to stop the Player's words. In the Final Dark World, after Susie discovers and shatters the final prophecy, Ralsei breaks down into tears. If the Player tells Ralsei \"It's okay not to smile\", Ralsei will mention that if there is another path besides the one they're on, that it could possibly be worse. Finally, as the night comes to an end, the Fountains are sealed, and Kris returns home to find their mother dancing with Sans, Kris decides to go to bed early when they're called by Mayor Carol, who leaves a message, asking if Kris is going to the festival tomorrow, as Noelle really is looking forward to seeing them there. As the chapter comes to a close, we see an image of that once small, red pixel, having become far larger by comparison..."

During a battle, Queen explains that any Lightner with enough Determination is able to open Dark Fountains, and that she was planning to use Noelle as a substitute Knight because the original one had taken its leave, intending to blanket the world in darkness and thus create a reality which the Lightners would enjoy. Despite using the term \"Roaring Knight\", Queen was seemingly unaware of the catastrophic effects the Roaring would have on both the Dark and Light Worlds, and abandons her plan when Ralsei explains what would happen. This may indicate that \"Roaring Knight\" is a name that the Knight themselves chose."

Nevertheless, he ultimately agrees to return Toriel to the heroes even though it is not what he believes the Knight wants. Immediately afterwards, the Knight arrives and slashes both of Tenna's arms off at the shoulder simultaneously, striking him down; if the party has not recruited all of TV World's Darkners, these injuries prove fatal. The Knight casts a beam of light from the hole in their right hand in an attempt to abduct Toriel before Susie confronts them with her axe and initiates a battle. Even if the party \"defeats\" them, the battle will end with everyone being knocked out by the Knight. With the little strength she has left, Susie grabs and pulls on the Knight's leg in order to stop them from taking Toriel, but Officer Undyne suddenly appears and intervenes with her spears. Distracted from Toriel, the Knight transforms into a birdlike form and abducts Undyne instead, flying away despite her protests and taking her through a Great Door to the Light World. Toriel and Ralsei remain in the Dark World while Kris and Susie follow the Knight all the way to the Shelter. The Shelter's doors shut behind them, leaving Kris and Susie locked outside. After Susie leaves, Kris examines the shelter's code lock, and the doors crack open right before the chapter ends."

When Kris and Susie enter the Dark Sanctuary the Knight is waiting near the Dark Fountain, quickly incapacitating Susie with a barrage of black knives and leaving Kris to attempt to give chase. Even if Kris avoids the subsequent knife attacks on the way up the stairs, they apparently chooses not to attack upon reaching the Knight and are ultimately struck from the platform to fall with Susie to a lower area. As the party works their way back toward the Fountain, they can ask the Old Man about the Knight and learn that a figure with a knife fled through a door above the his study. Along the way, the Knight is directly mentioned in a phrase from the Prophecy, \"THE KNIGHT WHICH MAKES WITH BLACKENED KNIFE. SHALL DUEL WITH HEROES STRIFE BY STRIFE.\" Below the words, a stained glass panel depicts two hands encircling a knife. Their actions in the previous chapter are alluded to in another prophecy panel, this one depicting a television with a diagonal slash through its screen below the words \"THE LORD OF SCREENS, CLEAVED RED BY BLADE.\" If prompted to think of the Knight when Ralsei asks Kris to close their eyes, Kris imagines the Knight beginning to remove its helmet, but immediately tries very hard to think about Jockington and then opens their eyes to end the vision. The party must later avoid another knife-attack barrage by the Knight as they climb up to confront them, but the Knight escapes through a Great Door and the party is forced to seal the Lobby Fountain to seek a way into the adjacent Dark World inside the church's Main Hall."

The Knight is nowhere to be found after the Titan's defeat.

This allows you to save revive mints for Susie who is the spearhead of the attack.

If the party seems to defeat the Knight, Susie and Ralsei are suddenly attacked and \"swooned,\" but Kris is spared; after this, the Knight rests their blade on Kris's shoulder and Kris kneels beneath its touch like a squire being knighted by a superior, suggesting a connection between the two. If the player gets a no-hit fight until the pre-Crystal Nova attack turn, a line of text will say: \"*Kris coughed; *The enemy slowly tilted their head.\" This suggests a subtle communication or signal from Kris to the Knight. Kris also actively sabotages attempts to get the code to the shelter where the Knight fled, refrains from attacking the Knight despite Susie's urging if they successfully get near them in the Dark Sanctuary, and subverts prompts which have the potential to reveal information about the Knight. If prompted to think about the Knight while closing their eyes, Kris thinks very hard about Jockington instead, and turns the knob of the church closet door in which the Knight might be hiding but does not open it."

        "content": "Alternatively, the Knight may also be Papyrus, who appears to be isolated and in a bad mental state during the events of the game, and has many connections to the Roaring Knight and it's dark words. Though often taken lightheartedly, there is quite a bit of evidence for it. while in Undertale Papyrus is shown to be sociable, in Deltarune Papyrus hasn't left his house for 3 chapters straight, while we hear a \"distant trousle of bones\" that slowly fades until dissapearing completely in Chapter 4. In Undertale, the word Bonetrousle seems to mean something like \"annoyed\" or troubled\" as Papyrus is mentioning to be \"slighty bonetrousled\" with the protagonist's escape. this would imply that Papyrus is not in a good mental state when we hear him at the door. Dating Tense! and Black Knife have a very similar chord progression, with 0:12–0:18 in Dating Tense! being the exact same as 0:36–0:39 in Black Knife. On Undertale's 9th Anniversary, the newsletter included an interview titled \"The Number Nine\" where the interviewer asks the main cast what they think of the number nine. Sans makes the \"Seven Ate Nine\" pun, which Papyrus takes to heart and exclaims he refuses to believe Seven Ate Nine. Alphys brings up that it is just a pun, to which Papyrus proposes the counterpun \"Five Sicks Seven\", making Seven a \"MISLED ANTIHERO\" and Five the true villain, \"AN IRRESPONSIBLE DOG OWNER\". while Undyne says that if Seven loved Nine they just felt like they was doing what they felt they needed to, but Toriel disagrees calling Seven weak and saying duty is no reason to harm another. Sans proposes that if Seven is a misled antihero Negative Seven could be \"a villain who thinks he's good\". Papyrus however claims Sans is starting with the wrong premise and that the number order is how they should figure out Negative Seven's motivation: Negative Seven Negative Eat Negative Nine. They debate what Negative Eating is but eventually acccept Toriel's idea that it is cooking. Alphys's formula tells us that Negative Seven is Papyrus who made Sans(Negative Five) cook for him, and Papyrus is suprised about being the villain, so Sans says that maybe he is just someone who seems like an enemy but is actually a good guy, which worries Papyrus even more saying why would he ever seem like an enemy. This brings up the idea of Papyrus being a twist villain who thinks he's good. When battling the Knight, the Roaring Knight defeating Ralsei or Susie will drop their HP to -999, connecting the Knight to the number nine and by extension this interview. Papyrus is Negative Seven and parallels to Seven, with 7 being the amount of confirmed chapters there are in Deltarune. The Knight is implied to have a liking for hiding in the closet, as both in Chapter 2 and 4 there are closets described as large enough for someone to fit inside. Kris, even if prompted, will not open the church closet in Chapter 4, blocking any investigation as to whether there is someone in the closet after the church's Dark Worlds are sealed. In Undertale, when you interact with Papyrus's closet, he will say \"THERE ARE NO SKELETONS INSIDE MY CLOSET!!! EXCECT ME SOMETIMES.\" The Knight is also implied to be a \"large person\" in these dialogues, and Papyrus is quite tall and is reffered to as \"the tall skeleton\" by Doggo in Undertale. Bonetrousle and Black Knife have the same percussion. In Undertale, Papyrus states his trash is named Trashy and lives inside a garbage can. Trashy exists as a Darkner in Deltarune. Papyrus and the Knight have the same identical whine-glass body shape. The Roaring Knight's ribcage opens up when it roars, again implying it is a skeleton. In the Undertale Kickstarter OST, there’s a unique track called “PAPYRUS’S COOL SONG” that features distinct “hoo” sounds. The very same “hoo” sounds appear again in “You Know What This Is” from the TobyFox.net OST, where they echo a leitmotif from another Toby Fox composition made for Cucumber Quest, titled “Nightmare Knight.”"

Before they can rescue her though, they are discovered by Tenna who forces them into a final board against their will. The charm of the games has died out and begins to show how desperate Tenna is, how much he craves attention, and how he is afraid of \"The family fighting again\". After a few battles, the Fun Gang manage to get away and explore the wider TV World, and even encountering a fun Cowboy Game in the process. As they wander through TV World, they cause mayhem, initiating a mass walkout by Tenna's employees, that leaves his studio abandoned, and cause Lanino and Elnina to split from Rouxls and return to their own previous relationship. Eventually, getting back to the TV Time Studio, they find it empty and cold, much of the remaining Darkners of TV World slowly turning to stone due to their actions.

He says he used to be watched all the time and is now abandoned. He says that the Roaring Knight appeared, and told him that if he followed their orders, he would never be unwatched again.

At the church, Kris can speak with various characters, including Noelle who seems to desire to have a private conversation with Kris later. After explaining everything they learned about the shelter to Susie, Kris and Susie are interrupted by Noelle who seems interested in having Kris and Susie over for a study session. When Susie wishes to celebrate their lucky break with a high-five, Kris leaves them hanging due to being too interested in Noelle, to which Susie mentions how much things seem to have taken a \"weird route\" for Noelle to ask them like that. After church, Kris and Susie can optionally choose to visit Berdly in the hospital, to which only Kris wishes to go into his room. When in there, Kris finds an unconscious Berdly which they can choose to either leave alone, or warm up by interacting with the space heater and changing his hot water bottle. Doing so shows that Berdly relaxes, and insinuates he might be feeling a little better. When exiting the room, Susie asks Kris to be sure he didn't give them the \"Bird Flu\". After getting to the Holiday Household, everything Proceeds as usual until Kris sets off to investigate December's guitar. At that time, Noelle corners Kris in the upstairs, causing Kris, who had just previously pulled their SOUL out to hide it in the nearest drawer as Noelle says they want to speak with them privately in her room. After Noelle is gone, Kris hurries down stairs to shove the heart in a giftbox until the conversation is over. However, the SOUL escapes by venting out of the room. Traveling through the house's air vents, the SOUL eventually makes its way to Noelle's room to eavesdrop on their conversation. Noelle begins the conversation by rehashing something Kris did without the Player's presence the night before, after sealing the Cyber World Dark Fountain. Noelle said that Kris visited them after taking Berdly to the hospital and that they comforted Noelle by telling her that it was all a silly prank. But when Noelle asks Kris if it's okay if they say something, the player is given the option to tell her too \"Proceed\". Now in the room, the SOUL can join with Kris again. If the SOUL does not join with Kris quick enough, Kris will escape the room with Noelle, causing the Weird Route to be aborted. If the SOUL joins with Kris, as Noelle is trying to mention the things they told her not to mention to anyone else, Kris covers her mouth. When Noelle asks who they're afraid will hear, the Player may then assert it's presence by selecting \"Me\". From here, the Player forces Kris to draw closer to Noelle, reading the girl's mind, and basically chanting \"Proceed\". The Player may then \"Equip\" Noelle with the thorn representing the Thorn Ring, resulting in an image like broken glass glowing red with the SOUL's power. After this, a distraught and enraged Kris will take the SOUL to the bathroom and shove it in the trashcan before electing to kick the can and harm the SOUL, even at their own expense, only stopping when Asgore, who is visiting the house to help clean it, calls in and asks if they're okay. After this, leaving the Holiday Residence, Asgore gives Kris some hot-chocolate he pilfered from the Holidays. Heading out through Hometown, Susie mentions how upset she is that they didn't get to hang out with Noelle, and felt something strange when Noelle mentioned she wanted to talk to Kris alone, asking what they could talk about that Susie couldn't be included in. The SOUL is given no dialogue options, yet a choice in an empty box. Oddly enough, it stops raining and becomes sunny only during this empty choice, and Susie assumes it didn't have anything to do with her. After this, there's less references to the Weird Route, at least while in the Sanctuary Dark Worlds. When Susie leaves to collect information about the notes to be played on the piano, Ralsei asks if Kris would like to think about what Susie's doing. If the Player refuses to think about her, an option is given to think about Noelle. When doing so, the Player views a small red pixel that, after floating and slightly glowing for a moment, says \"Thank you...\" in Noelle's voice. Upon returning to Kris, the Player finds Kris on the ground, likely having had a panic attack, Susie tending to them. Susie notices Ralsei wasn't there and scolds him upon returning. When Kris is confronted by the Old Man, asking them where to go, Kris can respond \"Nowhere\" to which he will mention that it sounds like they're having \"Relationship Trouble\". During the tea party, the Old Man will mention how Kris seems to just be going through the motions, and tries to help them keep their chin up, telling them that it'll all be better, before offering Kris an apple which they ravenously devour, even part of the core. After sealing the first Dark Fountain, when searching for the combination to the lock on the door to the inner sanctuary, they find a shelf for prayer candles. Susie asks who Kris will pray for as they light a candle, and if the Player chooses \"Noelle\", Kris will kick the shelf violently. Later, when in the Choir chamber, Susie mentions about the piano and a story she had with one. Susie asks if Kris will keep playing the piano, and if the Player chooses \"I will never play again\", Kris will bite their own hand to stop the Player's words. In the Final Dark World, after Susie discovers and shatters the final prophecy, Ralsei breaks down into tears. If the Player tells Ralsei \"It's okay not to smile\", Ralsei will mention that if there is another path besides the one they're on, that it could possibly be worse. Finally, as the night comes to an end, the Fountains are sealed, and Kris returns home to find their mother dancing with Sans, Kris decides to go to bed early when they're called by Mayor Carol, who leaves a message, asking if Kris is going to the festival tomorrow, as Noelle really is looking forward to seeing them there. As the chapter comes to a close, we see an image of that once small, red pixel, having become far larger by comparison..."

King similarly also believes that making more Dark Fountains and letting them consume the world would allow Darkners to rule the world, seemingly unaware it would mean the end of Darkners and condemn the Lightners instead, implying that the Knight was giving them incomplete information. Despite this, Queen still refers to the Knight as the \"Roaring Knight\" when approaching her after freeing Berdly from her control, which occurs before she is aware of what The Roaring is at all. This could suggest that this specific moniker is self-given by them and that the Knight is trying to bring about the Roaring, or that it was given to them by a third party. Unlike with Queen, Ralsei has seemingly made no attempt to inform King about the Roaring, even after imprisoning him in Chapter 2. The reason for that is unknown."

Once the ride is over, Susie leaves Noelle with Berdly and rejoins Kris and Ralsei.

The fight itself is mostly the same until Spamton NEO reaches 10% of his HP. At this point, the music changes, and his AT is greatly lowered but his DF is greatly increased. Kris's damage done by normal attacks is capped at 10 (about 0.2% of his HP), and Spamton NEO's HP cannot be reduced below 6% (about 289) as he will automatically recover HP with Pipis whenever this occurs. However, Spamton exclusively uses a weaker, simpler attack that is much easier to dodge until the end of the fight. The battle can only be concluded by ACTing multiple times: first having Kris call for Ralsei and Susie twice each, which ends in failure each time; then having the player call for Noelle, which causes the screen to cut to black, after which she presumably shows up and deals massive damage to Spamton.

The minibosses are all encountered in different locations and are noticeably stronger. The Chain Mail, Glowshard, Revive Mint, and Revive Dust cannot be obtained. From the entrance hall, the stairs to the left and right are both blocked by forcefields. The rooms with items based on various Hometown residents' search history are no longer accessible. The shortcut to the second floor is open immediately and must be used to progress. After reaching 2F, a forcefield blocks the player from backtracking the usual way to 1F. All paintings of Queen are replaced by paintings of Spamton, and none of the paintings emit fire. On the second floor, the door to the kitchen is locked and the Mauswheel miniboss instead roams the area outside the kitchen. It is now an optional battle. The dining room now contains a maze made up entirely of Pipis, an enemy that never appears as its own fightable opponent outside of this route and otherwise only appears as part of one of Spamton NEO's attacks. Bumping into one triggers a battle. The next two rooms also contain different types of Pipis encounters. The \"throne of the gods\" side room is now blocked with a forcefield and another side room is locked. The Tasque Manager miniboss appears in the hallway before the lift to the third floor. Her mercy meter can no longer be filled by correctly answering quiz questions. Kris and Ralsei do not get covered in tea at the end of the teacup ride to the third floor, and Susie does not eat the tea drops. After reaching the third floor, Werewerewire appears in the room to the left (instead of appearing on the rooftop). The film portraying a dark fountain is no longer present. The battery acid lake cannot be crossed. As a result, the party does not reach the point where they would battle Rouxls Kaard, and the Thrash Machine never makes an appearance. The shortcut from 3F to the entrance hall may be unlocked normally. The shortcut from 3F to the rooftop is open immediately and must be used to progress. A forcefield prevents the player from backtracking the usual way from the rooftop down to 3F."

It is triggered by choosing exclusively aggressive/violent options in battle and causes significant changes in dialogue, story, and encounters as a result. Additionally, the player must actively go out of their way to trigger and subsequently remain on this route, making it a goal to fulfill all of the route's conditions (given that simply playing the game normally while responding aggressively to ordinary encounters is not enough to trigger the route). Music in the overworld and some battles becomes slowed and distorted. Puzzles in the overworld become disabled, either automatically or by actions outside of the player's direct control. Optional areas are blocked off by forcefields, forcing Kris along a more linear path. The dumpster displays the number of enemies remaining in the area, a trait shared by Undertale's ut:SAVE Points after starting the Genocide Route. The final boss of the route is significantly more difficult than the standard final boss. Even though Spamton NEO can be encountered optionally on the normal route, only Kris is present during the fight on the Weird Route, increasing the difficulty further. The final boss also attempts to stall Kris out at the end of the fight, giving up on offensive tactics in favor of ones designed to indefinitely delay defeat. During the final phase of the battle with Spamton NEO, attempting to call on Ralsei or Susie displays the text ..\". but nobody came.\" This is a recurring phrase in the Genocide Route, usually displayed when all the monsters in an area have been killed."

Susie and Ralsei notice Kris seems off and possibly hurt after the fight with Berdly, which could indicate they are distraught. If Kris is downed during the fight with Berdly, Noelle comments on how she can still hear their voice, hinting that it isn't Kris's voice she's hearing. She also argues as normal when asked to use SnowGrave even if Kris is down. When calling out for help from Susie and Ralsei, the game refers to \"Kris.\" When calling out for Noelle, the game refers to \"you,\" which could be the player in the second person.

Feeling undervalued, Susie leaves Kris and Ralsei for a time and teams up with Lancer. Susie's friendship with Lancer helps her become more compassionate.

Investigating a door that had been barred by one of Tenna's henchmen, they discover Toriel outside of the studio in the frozen wasteland. Before they can rescue her though, they are discovered by Tenna who forces them into a final board against their will. The charm of the games has died out and begins to show how desperate Tenna is, how much he craves attention, and how he is afraid of \"The family fighting again\". After a few battles, the Fun Gang manage to get away and explore the wider TV World, and even encountering a fun Cowboy Game in the process. As they wander through TV World, they cause mayhem, initiating a mass walkout by Tenna's employees, that leaves his studio abandoned, and cause Lanino and Elnina to split from Rouxls and return to their own previous relationship. Eventually, getting back to the TV Time Studio, they find it empty and cold, much of the remaining Darkners of TV World slowly turning to stone due to their actions. Entering in, they head back toward where they found Toriel before, only to encounter Tenna again, who eventually explains why he wants to play games so badly, referencing Kris' homelife, the subtle quarrel with the Dreemurrs and the Holidays, as well as the break-up of Asgore and Toriel. He says he used to be watched all the time and is now abandoned. He says that the Roaring Knight appeared, and told him that if he followed their orders, he would never be unwatched again. When he then tries to force them into a new round, Susie refuses, causing Tenna to initiate a battle with the Fun Gang. But after a short battle, he is defeated, and proceeds to admit that he just doesn't want to be thrown away. Ralsei tries to get him to accept it for peace of mind that he, like all Darkners, will become obsolete. But Susie pushes past Ralsei and informs Tenna that it doesn't have to be that way. She tells him that she also knows what it's like to be thrown away, and explains how she found Kris and Ralsei, and found a place to belong, and that he will to."

Kris goes to seal the Fountain alone but is stopped by Spamton, who upgraded himself into Spamton NEO while Queen was looking for Berdly. Fighting Spamton, Kris calls for help from Susie and Ralsei, who do not respond. The player then calls for help from Noelle, who freezes Spamton. Kris seals the fountain. In the Light World, Berdly is found unresponsive, and Noelle may question whether the Dark World really was a dream if visited at the Hospital. The route ends the same way as the normal route, with Kris opening a Dark Fountain."

        "content": "Chapter 4 however continues the Weird Route through various scenes. At the church, Kris can speak with various characters, including Noelle who seems to desire to have a private conversation with Kris later. After explaining everything they learned about the shelter to Susie, Kris and Susie are interrupted by Noelle who seems interested in having Kris and Susie over for a study session. When Susie wishes to celebrate their lucky break with a high-five, Kris leaves them hanging due to being too interested in Noelle, to which Susie mentions how much things seem to have taken a \"weird route\" for Noelle to ask them like that. After church, Kris and Susie can optionally choose to visit Berdly in the hospital, to which only Kris wishes to go into his room. When in there, Kris finds an unconscious Berdly which they can choose to either leave alone, or warm up by interacting with the space heater and changing his hot water bottle. Doing so shows that Berdly relaxes, and insinuates he might be feeling a little better. When exiting the room, Susie asks Kris to be sure he didn't give them the \"Bird Flu\". After getting to the Holiday Household, everything Proceeds as usual until Kris sets off to investigate December's guitar. At that time, Noelle corners Kris in the upstairs, causing Kris, who had just previously pulled their SOUL out to hide it in the nearest drawer as Noelle says they want to speak with them privately in her room. After Noelle is gone, Kris hurries down stairs to shove the heart in a giftbox until the conversation is over. However, the SOUL escapes by venting out of the room. Traveling through the house's air vents, the SOUL eventually makes its way to Noelle's room to eavesdrop on their conversation. Noelle begins the conversation by rehashing something Kris did without the Player's presence the night before, after sealing the Cyber World Dark Fountain. Noelle said that Kris visited them after taking Berdly to the hospital and that they comforted Noelle by telling her that it was all a silly prank. But when Noelle asks Kris if it's okay if they say something, the player is given the option to tell her too \"Proceed\". Now in the room, the SOUL can join with Kris again. If the SOUL does not join with Kris quick enough, Kris will escape the room with Noelle, causing the Weird Route to be aborted. If the SOUL joins with Kris, as Noelle is trying to mention the things they told her not to mention to anyone else, Kris covers her mouth. When Noelle asks who they're afraid will hear, the Player may then assert it's presence by selecting \"Me\". From here, the Player forces Kris to draw closer to Noelle, reading the girl's mind, and basically chanting \"Proceed\". The Player may then \"Equip\" Noelle with the thorn representing the Thorn Ring, resulting in an image like broken glass glowing red with the SOUL's power. After this, a distraught and enraged Kris will take the SOUL to the bathroom and shove it in the trashcan before electing to kick the can and harm the SOUL, even at their own expense, only stopping when Asgore, who is visiting the house to help clean it, calls in and asks if they're okay. After this, leaving the Holiday Residence, Asgore gives Kris some hot-chocolate he pilfered from the Holidays. Heading out through Hometown, Susie mentions how upset she is that they didn't get to hang out with Noelle, and felt something strange when Noelle mentioned she wanted to talk to Kris alone, asking what they could talk about that Susie couldn't be included in. The SOUL is given no dialogue options, yet a choice in an empty box. Oddly enough, it stops raining and becomes sunny only during this empty choice, and Susie assumes it didn't have anything to do with her. After this, there's less references to the Weird Route, at least while in the Sanctuary Dark Worlds. When Susie leaves to collect information about the notes to be played on the piano, Ralsei asks if Kris would like to think about what Susie's doing. If the Player refuses to think about her, an option is given to think about Noelle. When doing so, the Player views a small red pixel that, after floating and slightly glowing for a moment, says \"Thank you...\" in Noelle's voice. Upon returning to Kris, the Player finds Kris on the ground, likely having had a panic attack, Susie tending to them. Susie notices Ralsei wasn't there and scolds him upon returning. When Kris is confronted by the Old Man, asking them where to go, Kris can respond \"Nowhere\" to which he will mention that it sounds like they're having \"Relationship Trouble\". During the tea party, the Old Man will mention how Kris seems to just be going through the motions, and tries to help them keep their chin up, telling them that it'll all be better, before offering Kris an apple which they ravenously devour, even part of the core. After sealing the first Dark Fountain, when searching for the combination to the lock on the door to the inner sanctuary, they find a shelf for prayer candles. Susie asks who Kris will pray for as they light a candle, and if the Player chooses \"Noelle\", Kris will kick the shelf violently. Later, when in the Choir chamber, Susie mentions about the piano and a story she had with one. Susie asks if Kris will keep playing the piano, and if the Player chooses \"I will never play again\", Kris will bite their own hand to stop the Player's words. In the Final Dark World, after Susie discovers and shatters the final prophecy, Ralsei breaks down into tears. If the Player tells Ralsei \"It's okay not to smile\", Ralsei will mention that if there is another path besides the one they're on, that it could possibly be worse. Finally, as the night comes to an end, the Fountains are sealed, and Kris returns home to find their mother dancing with Sans, Kris decides to go to bed early when they're called by Mayor Carol, who leaves a message, asking if Kris is going to the festival tomorrow, as Noelle really is looking forward to seeing them there. As the chapter comes to a close, we see an image of that once small, red pixel, having become far larger by comparison..."

        "content": "Kris is shown to have a significant amount of agency outside of the player's choices when in the Light world. This is most clearly shown in scenes where Kris rips the SOUL out of their body, but also in how characters react to Kris's dialogue choices: occasionally, the player may choose an option that other characters note sounds like Kris is straining to say. Kris is also shown performing actions independently of the player's control, including protecting Susie from King or awkwardly trying to escape the Sweet Cap'n Cakes fight with Ralsei and Susie, showing their friendship with the two exists outside of the player's influence. Additionally, there are some instances in Chapter 2 where Kris stops inspecting something relating to their home life, preventing the player from learning more: when inspecting Asriel's room in Queen's Mansion, Kris closes their eyes before peeking into Asriel's room in the Guest Hall; when inspecting an article about Asgore's firing and Undyne's promotion, Kris intentionally stops reading before the reason is given. The separation between the player and Kris is most clearly shown in the Weird Route, where it is heavily implied Kris's actions are being done against their will. Noelle describes the voice she heard giving her orders as terrifying, noting Kris has been acting very strange lately. When Kris reunites with the party after defeating Berdly, Susie and Ralsei immediately notice Kris appears distraught."

If the player responds to Susie that they're okay by saying Yes, Kris appears strained in their response, making Susie think that they're not okay; if the player responds to Susie by saying No, Kris yells out the response, concerning Susie and Ralsei. This heavily implies that Spamton's dialogues about being a puppet and cutting his strings to be free, combined with Spamton's ultimate fate, deeply unsettled Kris."

Regardless of how the King was initially defeated, either Lancer and the King's subjects rescue the party, or Susie distracts King long enough for Ralsei to cast Pacify on the King, putting him to sleep.

This causes Berdly to become encased in a massive ice crystal. After this, Noelle leaves the party in a depressed daze, and Kris is led through a shortcut that leads them to Queen's mansion. Susie and Ralsei note that Kris is visibly distressed after the freezing of Berdly but proceed to Queen's mansion to stop her. In the castle they find that Spamton has taken over and filled the room with Pipis. When Queen abandons her plans, Kris is led by the player to close the Dark Fountain but is stopped by an agitated Spamton NEO, who proceeds to duel Kris in a final battle. While Kris is on the verge of losing and unable to call for allies, the player commands Noelle to help them, which leads to her using Iceshock on Spamton spell. Kris seals the Dark Fountain alone, and the party wakes up in the computer lab. Berdly does not wake up, but is revealed to be comatose from the spell."

As Ralsei reveals in this chapter, all of the Darkners are parallels of real world objects, and Tenna is actually the Darkner form of Kris's old CRT TV in their living room. Tenna repeatedly speaks to Kris directly during the show, reminding them of their nostalgic memories watching TV and playing games with Asriel as a child. If the player unlocks S-Rank on Tenna's first board, they have the option to pursue the \"Sword Route\". In this route Kris enters the S-Rank room and speaks to Ramb, who reveals to Kris that the game the party played wasn’t the original one, as Tenna modified his own version. He then tells Kris he set up the original game backstage and urges them to play to experience freedom. Kris and the player receive an odd controller and proceed to start up the game taking control of the HERO_SWORD sprite.

Susie leaves, but Kris stays behind and inspects the secret code, and watches as the door to the shelter creaks open."

Nevertheless, Ralsei remains convinced that they have good in them and that fighting is not necessary in this world.

In chapter 3, his personality and character development go deeper; he reveals that he believes he doesn't exist.

Ralsei suggests Kris to order the party to dance to distract the rebels from fighting them, but they are unable to make them all dance at the same time. Susie points out to Ralsei that she does not need Kris's orders to dance and teaches him to dance by himself. They eventually succeed and befriend the trio. Later, the party finds three roller-coasters themed after themselves. Ralsei suggests riding them to reach the Dark Fountain, but during their ride, they meet Queen waiting for them and sending Berdly to fight. After winning the battle, Queen tells the party that the roller-coaster is not finished before letting them crash into Cyber City's Trash Zone down below. After landing into Trash Zone, Susie is hurt and Ralsei asks her if she wants him to check. She declines but he does it anyway, using a healing spell by hugging her. Ralsei then proposes to teach her his healing spell, and she accepts. Before leaving the Trash Zone, Ralsei informs Kris about adjusting their inventory, to which Susie comments that it seems like useful information."

A video of this event plays in a room in Queen's Mansion, but there is too much smoke to identify the Knight. Spamton, in his shop, makes the implication that the Knight is related to \"[[Communion]],\" and starts to tell Kris something about them, but mysteriously cuts himself off. During a battle, Queen explains that any Lightner with enough Determination is able to open Dark Fountains, and that she was planning to use Noelle as a substitute Knight because the original one had taken its leave, intending to blanket the world in darkness and thus create a reality which the Lightners would enjoy. Despite using the term \"Roaring Knight\", Queen was seemingly unaware of the catastrophic effects the Roaring would have on both the Dark and Light Worlds, and abandons her plan when Ralsei explains what would happen. This may indicate that \"Roaring Knight\" is a name that the Knight themselves chose."

Nevertheless, he ultimately agrees to return Toriel to the heroes even though it is not what he believes the Knight wants. Immediately afterwards, the Knight arrives and slashes both of Tenna's arms off at the shoulder simultaneously, striking him down; if the party has not recruited all of TV World's Darkners, these injuries prove fatal. The Knight casts a beam of light from the hole in their right hand in an attempt to abduct Toriel before Susie confronts them with her axe and initiates a battle. Even if the party \"defeats\" them, the battle will end with everyone being knocked out by the Knight. With the little strength she has left, Susie grabs and pulls on the Knight's leg in order to stop them from taking Toriel, but Officer Undyne suddenly appears and intervenes with her spears. Distracted from Toriel, the Knight transforms into a birdlike form and abducts Undyne instead, flying away despite her protests and taking her through a Great Door to the Light World. Toriel and Ralsei remain in the Dark World while Kris and Susie follow the Knight all the way to the Shelter. The Shelter's doors shut behind them, leaving Kris and Susie locked outside. After Susie leaves, Kris examines the shelter's code lock, and the doors crack open right before the chapter ends."

When Kris and Susie enter the Dark Sanctuary the Knight is waiting near the Dark Fountain, quickly incapacitating Susie with a barrage of black knives and leaving Kris to attempt to give chase. Even if Kris avoids the subsequent knife attacks on the way up the stairs, they apparently chooses not to attack upon reaching the Knight and are ultimately struck from the platform to fall with Susie to a lower area. As the party works their way back toward the Fountain, they can ask the Old Man about the Knight and learn that a figure with a knife fled through a door above the his study. Along the way, the Knight is directly mentioned in a phrase from the Prophecy, \"THE KNIGHT WHICH MAKES WITH BLACKENED KNIFE. SHALL DUEL WITH HEROES STRIFE BY STRIFE.\" Below the words, a stained glass panel depicts two hands encircling a knife. Their actions in the previous chapter are alluded to in another prophecy panel, this one depicting a television with a diagonal slash through its screen below the words \"THE LORD OF SCREENS, CLEAVED RED BY BLADE.\" If prompted to think of the Knight when Ralsei asks Kris to close their eyes, Kris imagines the Knight beginning to remove its helmet, but immediately tries very hard to think about Jockington and then opens their eyes to end the vision. The party must later avoid another knife-attack barrage by the Knight as they climb up to confront them, but the Knight escapes through a Great Door and the party is forced to seal the Lobby Fountain to seek a way into the adjacent Dark World inside the church's Main Hall."

The Knight is nowhere to be found after the Titan's defeat. With the last Fountain sealed, Susie is surprised that the Knight is not present in the church, although Kris chooses not to follow prompts to open a closet door at the Main Hall's far end, even though a large person could easily fit inside."

Alternatively, Kris's main attack does more damage if Susie and/or Ralsei are down, but having only one character up is inherently risky and this strategy is not recommended unless it's the only viable option left.

This allows you to save revive mints for Susie who is the spearhead of the attack. While you may gain less TP due to Ralsei's defeat, you will save on healing items which can greatly extend the longevity of your healing items, which may be the boost you need to get to the final attack."

If the party seems to defeat the Knight, Susie and Ralsei are suddenly attacked and \"swooned,\" but Kris is spared; after this, the Knight rests their blade on Kris's shoulder and Kris kneels beneath its touch like a squire being knighted by a superior, suggesting a connection between the two. If the player gets a no-hit fight until the pre-Crystal Nova attack turn, a line of text will say: \"*Kris coughed; *The enemy slowly tilted their head.\" This suggests a subtle communication or signal from Kris to the Knight. Kris also actively sabotages attempts to get the code to the shelter where the Knight fled, refrains from attacking the Knight despite Susie's urging if they successfully get near them in the Dark Sanctuary, and subverts prompts which have the potential to reveal information about the Knight. If prompted to think about the Knight while closing their eyes, Kris thinks very hard about Jockington instead, and turns the knob of the church closet door in which the Knight might be hiding but does not open it."

        "content": "Alternatively, the Knight may also be Papyrus, who appears to be isolated and in a bad mental state during the events of the game, and has many connections to the Roaring Knight and it's dark words. Though often taken lightheartedly, there is quite a bit of evidence for it. while in Undertale Papyrus is shown to be sociable, in Deltarune Papyrus hasn't left his house for 3 chapters straight, while we hear a \"distant trousle of bones\" that slowly fades until dissapearing completely in Chapter 4. In Undertale, the word Bonetrousle seems to mean something like \"annoyed\" or troubled\" as Papyrus is mentioning to be \"slighty bonetrousled\" with the protagonist's escape. this would imply that Papyrus is not in a good mental state when we hear him at the door. Dating Tense! and Black Knife have a very similar chord progression, with 0:12–0:18 in Dating Tense! being the exact same as 0:36–0:39 in Black Knife. On Undertale's 9th Anniversary, the newsletter included an interview titled \"The Number Nine\" where the interviewer asks the main cast what they think of the number nine. Sans makes the \"Seven Ate Nine\" pun, which Papyrus takes to heart and exclaims he refuses to believe Seven Ate Nine. Alphys brings up that it is just a pun, to which Papyrus proposes the counterpun \"Five Sicks Seven\", making Seven a \"MISLED ANTIHERO\" and Five the true villain, \"AN IRRESPONSIBLE DOG OWNER\". while Undyne says that if Seven loved Nine they just felt like they was doing what they felt they needed to, but Toriel disagrees calling Seven weak and saying duty is no reason to harm another. Sans proposes that if Seven is a misled antihero Negative Seven could be \"a villain who thinks he's good\". Papyrus however claims Sans is starting with the wrong premise and that the number order is how they should figure out Negative Seven's motivation: Negative Seven Negative Eat Negative Nine. They debate what Negative Eating is but eventually acccept Toriel's idea that it is cooking. Alphys's formula tells us that Negative Seven is Papyrus who made Sans(Negative Five) cook for him, and Papyrus is suprised about being the villain, so Sans says that maybe he is just someone who seems like an enemy but is actually a good guy, which worries Papyrus even more saying why would he ever seem like an enemy. This brings up the idea of Papyrus being a twist villain who thinks he's good. When battling the Knight, the Roaring Knight defeating Ralsei or Susie will drop their HP to -999, connecting the Knight to the number nine and by extension this interview. Papyrus is Negative Seven and parallels to Seven, with 7 being the amount of confirmed chapters there are in Deltarune. The Knight is implied to have a liking for hiding in the closet, as both in Chapter 2 and 4 there are closets described as large enough for someone to fit inside. Kris, even if prompted, will not open the church closet in Chapter 4, blocking any investigation as to whether there is someone in the closet after the church's Dark Worlds are sealed. In Undertale, when you interact with Papyrus's closet, he will say \"THERE ARE NO SKELETONS INSIDE MY CLOSET!!! EXCECT ME SOMETIMES.\" The Knight is also implied to be a \"large person\" in these dialogues, and Papyrus is quite tall and is reffered to as \"the tall skeleton\" by Doggo in Undertale. Bonetrousle and Black Knife have the same percussion. In Undertale, Papyrus states his trash is named Trashy and lives inside a garbage can. Trashy exists as a Darkner in Deltarune. Papyrus and the Knight have the same identical whine-glass body shape. The Roaring Knight's ribcage opens up when it roars, again implying it is a skeleton. In the Undertale Kickstarter OST, there’s a unique track called “PAPYRUS’S COOL SONG” that features distinct “hoo” sounds. The very same “hoo” sounds appear again in “You Know What This Is” from the TobyFox.net OST, where they echo a leitmotif from another Toby Fox composition made for Cucumber Quest, titled “Nightmare Knight.”"

It's recommended to balance the party members' Defense to avoid having someone too frail that could constantly be taken down. It is suggested that the party fills their inventory with consumables, with the Top Cake/Spin Cake, Clubs Sandwich, and Revive Mints being the best to bring, although the player may want to save these more powerful items for the Spamton NEO or Queen's fight. The rest of the inventory should be filled with Darkburgers, Choco Diamonds and Hearts Donuts, which are the best items for Ralsei, Kris and Susie respectively.

Feeling undervalued, Susie leaves Kris and Ralsei for a time and teams up with Lancer. Susie's friendship with Lancer helps her become more compassionate.

From here, Susie questions how Ralsei can't be real when she can hear him and see him. Before they can get much deeper into it, they are interrupted by Tenna, who welcomes them to TV World.

Investigating a door that had been barred by one of Tenna's henchmen, they discover Toriel outside of the studio in the frozen wasteland. Before they can rescue her though, they are discovered by Tenna who forces them into a final board against their will. The charm of the games has died out and begins to show how desperate Tenna is, how much he craves attention, and how he is afraid of \"The family fighting again\". After a few battles, the Fun Gang manage to get away and explore the wider TV World, and even encountering a fun Cowboy Game in the process. As they wander through TV World, they cause mayhem, initiating a mass walkout by Tenna's employees, that leaves his studio abandoned, and cause Lanino and Elnina to split from Rouxls and return to their own previous relationship. Eventually, getting back to the TV Time Studio, they find it empty and cold, much of the remaining Darkners of TV World slowly turning to stone due to their actions. Entering in, they head back toward where they found Toriel before, only to encounter Tenna again, who eventually explains why he wants to play games so badly, referencing Kris' homelife, the subtle quarrel with the Dreemurrs and the Holidays, as well as the break-up of Asgore and Toriel. He says he used to be watched all the time and is now abandoned. He says that the Roaring Knight appeared, and told him that if he followed their orders, he would never be unwatched again. When he then tries to force them into a new round, Susie refuses, causing Tenna to initiate a battle with the Fun Gang. But after a short battle, he is defeated, and proceeds to admit that he just doesn't want to be thrown away. Ralsei tries to get him to accept it for peace of mind that he, like all Darkners, will become obsolete. But Susie pushes past Ralsei and informs Tenna that it doesn't have to be that way. She tells him that she also knows what it's like to be thrown away, and explains how she found Kris and Ralsei, and found a place to belong, and that he will to."

She then leaves Kris, shaken by her own actions, and is too exhausted to participate in Queen's plans. Ralsei informs the latter of the Roaring preemptively, avoiding her battle. Kris goes to seal the Fountain alone but is stopped by Spamton, who upgraded himself into Spamton NEO while Queen was looking for Berdly. Fighting Spamton, Kris calls for help from Susie and Ralsei, who do not respond. The player then calls for help from Noelle, who freezes Spamton. Kris seals the fountain.

At the church, Kris can speak with various characters, including Noelle who seems to desire to have a private conversation with Kris later. After explaining everything they learned about the shelter to Susie, Kris and Susie are interrupted by Noelle who seems interested in having Kris and Susie over for a study session. When Susie wishes to celebrate their lucky break with a high-five, Kris leaves them hanging due to being too interested in Noelle, to which Susie mentions how much things seem to have taken a \"weird route\" for Noelle to ask them like that. After church, Kris and Susie can optionally choose to visit Berdly in the hospital, to which only Kris wishes to go into his room. When in there, Kris finds an unconscious Berdly which they can choose to either leave alone, or warm up by interacting with the space heater and changing his hot water bottle. Doing so shows that Berdly relaxes, and insinuates he might be feeling a little better. When exiting the room, Susie asks Kris to be sure he didn't give them the \"Bird Flu\". After getting to the Holiday Household, everything Proceeds as usual until Kris sets off to investigate December's guitar. At that time, Noelle corners Kris in the upstairs, causing Kris, who had just previously pulled their SOUL out to hide it in the nearest drawer as Noelle says they want to speak with them privately in her room. After Noelle is gone, Kris hurries down stairs to shove the heart in a giftbox until the conversation is over. However, the SOUL escapes by venting out of the room. Traveling through the house's air vents, the SOUL eventually makes its way to Noelle's room to eavesdrop on their conversation. Noelle begins the conversation by rehashing something Kris did without the Player's presence the night before, after sealing the Cyber World Dark Fountain. Noelle said that Kris visited them after taking Berdly to the hospital and that they comforted Noelle by telling her that it was all a silly prank. But when Noelle asks Kris if it's okay if they say something, the player is given the option to tell her too \"Proceed\". Now in the room, the SOUL can join with Kris again. If the SOUL does not join with Kris quick enough, Kris will escape the room with Noelle, causing the Weird Route to be aborted. If the SOUL joins with Kris, as Noelle is trying to mention the things they told her not to mention to anyone else, Kris covers her mouth. When Noelle asks who they're afraid will hear, the Player may then assert it's presence by selecting \"Me\". From here, the Player forces Kris to draw closer to Noelle, reading the girl's mind, and basically chanting \"Proceed\". The Player may then \"Equip\" Noelle with the thorn representing the Thorn Ring, resulting in an image like broken glass glowing red with the SOUL's power. After this, a distraught and enraged Kris will take the SOUL to the bathroom and shove it in the trashcan before electing to kick the can and harm the SOUL, even at their own expense, only stopping when Asgore, who is visiting the house to help clean it, calls in and asks if they're okay. After this, leaving the Holiday Residence, Asgore gives Kris some hot-chocolate he pilfered from the Holidays. Heading out through Hometown, Susie mentions how upset she is that they didn't get to hang out with Noelle, and felt something strange when Noelle mentioned she wanted to talk to Kris alone, asking what they could talk about that Susie couldn't be included in. The SOUL is given no dialogue options, yet a choice in an empty box. Oddly enough, it stops raining and becomes sunny only during this empty choice, and Susie assumes it didn't have anything to do with her. After this, there's less references to the Weird Route, at least while in the Sanctuary Dark Worlds. When Susie leaves to collect information about the notes to be played on the piano, Ralsei asks if Kris would like to think about what Susie's doing. If the Player refuses to think about her, an option is given to think about Noelle. When doing so, the Player views a small red pixel that, after floating and slightly glowing for a moment, says \"Thank you...\" in Noelle's voice. Upon returning to Kris, the Player finds Kris on the ground, likely having had a panic attack, Susie tending to them. Susie notices Ralsei wasn't there and scolds him upon returning. When Kris is confronted by the Old Man, asking them where to go, Kris can respond \"Nowhere\" to which he will mention that it sounds like they're having \"Relationship Trouble\". During the tea party, the Old Man will mention how Kris seems to just be going through the motions, and tries to help them keep their chin up, telling them that it'll all be better, before offering Kris an apple which they ravenously devour, even part of the core. After sealing the first Dark Fountain, when searching for the combination to the lock on the door to the inner sanctuary, they find a shelf for prayer candles. Susie asks who Kris will pray for as they light a candle, and if the Player chooses \"Noelle\", Kris will kick the shelf violently. Later, when in the Choir chamber, Susie mentions about the piano and a story she had with one. Susie asks if Kris will keep playing the piano, and if the Player chooses \"I will never play again\", Kris will bite their own hand to stop the Player's words. In the Final Dark World, after Susie discovers and shatters the final prophecy, Ralsei breaks down into tears. If the Player tells Ralsei \"It's okay not to smile\", Ralsei will mention that if there is another path besides the one they're on, that it could possibly be worse. Finally, as the night comes to an end, the Fountains are sealed, and Kris returns home to find their mother dancing with Sans, Kris decides to go to bed early when they're called by Mayor Carol, who leaves a message, asking if Kris is going to the festival tomorrow, as Noelle really is looking forward to seeing them there. As the chapter comes to a close, we see an image of that once small, red pixel, having become far larger by comparison..."

Kris calls Ralsei and Susie for help twice each, but they do not respond. The player then calls Noelle, who responds and freezes Spamton.

To compensate, Kris gains two new abilities: X-Slash deals massive physical damage for 25% TP, and Fried Pipis heals Kris for 120 HP at the cost of 32% TP. The fight itself is mostly the same until Spamton NEO reaches 10% of his HP. At this point, the music changes, and his AT is greatly lowered but his DF is greatly increased. Kris's damage done by normal attacks is capped at 10 (about 0.2% of his HP), and Spamton NEO's HP cannot be reduced below 6% (about 289) as he will automatically recover HP with Pipis whenever this occurs. However, Spamton exclusively uses a weaker, simpler attack that is much easier to dodge until the end of the fight. The battle can only be concluded by ACTing multiple times: first having Kris call for Ralsei and Susie twice each, which ends in failure each time; then having the player call for Noelle, which causes the screen to cut to black, after which she presumably shows up and deals massive damage to Spamton.

Additionally, the player must actively go out of their way to trigger and subsequently remain on this route, making it a goal to fulfill all of the route's conditions (given that simply playing the game normally while responding aggressively to ordinary encounters is not enough to trigger the route). Music in the overworld and some battles becomes slowed and distorted. Puzzles in the overworld become disabled, either automatically or by actions outside of the player's direct control. Optional areas are blocked off by forcefields, forcing Kris along a more linear path. The dumpster displays the number of enemies remaining in the area, a trait shared by Undertale's ut:SAVE Points after starting the Genocide Route. The final boss of the route is significantly more difficult than the standard final boss. Even though Spamton NEO can be encountered optionally on the normal route, only Kris is present during the fight on the Weird Route, increasing the difficulty further.

Susie and Ralsei notice Kris seems off and possibly hurt after the fight with Berdly, which could indicate they are distraught.

During their adventure, they meet Lancer, a goofy bad guy determined to stop them from reaching his kingdom's Dark Fountain. Feeling undervalued, Susie leaves Kris and Ralsei for a time and teams up with Lancer. Susie's friendship with Lancer helps her become more compassionate. The whole cast ends up uniting into a single team of four. In the end, Lancer helps the trio overthrow his cruel father, King.

From here, Susie questions how Ralsei can't be real when she can hear him and see him. Before they can get much deeper into it, they are interrupted by Tenna, who welcomes them to TV World.

Investigating a door that had been barred by one of Tenna's henchmen, they discover Toriel outside of the studio in the frozen wasteland. Before they can rescue her though, they are discovered by Tenna who forces them into a final board against their will. The charm of the games has died out and begins to show how desperate Tenna is, how much he craves attention, and how he is afraid of \"The family fighting again\". After a few battles, the Fun Gang manage to get away and explore the wider TV World, and even encountering a fun Cowboy Game in the process. As they wander through TV World, they cause mayhem, initiating a mass walkout by Tenna's employees, that leaves his studio abandoned, and cause Lanino and Elnina to split from Rouxls and return to their own previous relationship. Eventually, getting back to the TV Time Studio, they find it empty and cold, much of the remaining Darkners of TV World slowly turning to stone due to their actions. Entering in, they head back toward where they found Toriel before, only to encounter Tenna again, who eventually explains why he wants to play games so badly, referencing Kris' homelife, the subtle quarrel with the Dreemurrs and the Holidays, as well as the break-up of Asgore and Toriel. He says he used to be watched all the time and is now abandoned. He says that the Roaring Knight appeared, and told him that if he followed their orders, he would never be unwatched again. When he then tries to force them into a new round, Susie refuses, causing Tenna to initiate a battle with the Fun Gang. But after a short battle, he is defeated, and proceeds to admit that he just doesn't want to be thrown away. Ralsei tries to get him to accept it for peace of mind that he, like all Darkners, will become obsolete. But Susie pushes past Ralsei and informs Tenna that it doesn't have to be that way. She tells him that she also knows what it's like to be thrown away, and explains how she found Kris and Ralsei, and found a place to belong, and that he will to."

Fighting Spamton, Kris calls for help from Susie and Ralsei, who do not respond. The player then calls for help from Noelle, who freezes Spamton. Kris seals the fountain. In the Light World, Berdly is found unresponsive, and Noelle may question whether the Dark World really was a dream if visited at the Hospital. The route ends the same way as the normal route, with Kris opening a Dark Fountain."

        "content": "Chapter 4 however continues the Weird Route through various scenes. At the church, Kris can speak with various characters, including Noelle who seems to desire to have a private conversation with Kris later. After explaining everything they learned about the shelter to Susie, Kris and Susie are interrupted by Noelle who seems interested in having Kris and Susie over for a study session. When Susie wishes to celebrate their lucky break with a high-five, Kris leaves them hanging due to being too interested in Noelle, to which Susie mentions how much things seem to have taken a \"weird route\" for Noelle to ask them like that. After church, Kris and Susie can optionally choose to visit Berdly in the hospital, to which only Kris wishes to go into his room. When in there, Kris finds an unconscious Berdly which they can choose to either leave alone, or warm up by interacting with the space heater and changing his hot water bottle. Doing so shows that Berdly relaxes, and insinuates he might be feeling a little better. When exiting the room, Susie asks Kris to be sure he didn't give them the \"Bird Flu\". After getting to the Holiday Household, everything Proceeds as usual until Kris sets off to investigate December's guitar. At that time, Noelle corners Kris in the upstairs, causing Kris, who had just previously pulled their SOUL out to hide it in the nearest drawer as Noelle says they want to speak with them privately in her room. After Noelle is gone, Kris hurries down stairs to shove the heart in a giftbox until the conversation is over. However, the SOUL escapes by venting out of the room. Traveling through the house's air vents, the SOUL eventually makes its way to Noelle's room to eavesdrop on their conversation. Noelle begins the conversation by rehashing something Kris did without the Player's presence the night before, after sealing the Cyber World Dark Fountain. Noelle said that Kris visited them after taking Berdly to the hospital and that they comforted Noelle by telling her that it was all a silly prank. But when Noelle asks Kris if it's okay if they say something, the player is given the option to tell her too \"Proceed\". Now in the room, the SOUL can join with Kris again. If the SOUL does not join with Kris quick enough, Kris will escape the room with Noelle, causing the Weird Route to be aborted. If the SOUL joins with Kris, as Noelle is trying to mention the things they told her not to mention to anyone else, Kris covers her mouth. When Noelle asks who they're afraid will hear, the Player may then assert it's presence by selecting \"Me\". From here, the Player forces Kris to draw closer to Noelle, reading the girl's mind, and basically chanting \"Proceed\". The Player may then \"Equip\" Noelle with the thorn representing the Thorn Ring, resulting in an image like broken glass glowing red with the SOUL's power. After this, a distraught and enraged Kris will take the SOUL to the bathroom and shove it in the trashcan before electing to kick the can and harm the SOUL, even at their own expense, only stopping when Asgore, who is visiting the house to help clean it, calls in and asks if they're okay. After this, leaving the Holiday Residence, Asgore gives Kris some hot-chocolate he pilfered from the Holidays. Heading out through Hometown, Susie mentions how upset she is that they didn't get to hang out with Noelle, and felt something strange when Noelle mentioned she wanted to talk to Kris alone, asking what they could talk about that Susie couldn't be included in. The SOUL is given no dialogue options, yet a choice in an empty box. Oddly enough, it stops raining and becomes sunny only during this empty choice, and Susie assumes it didn't have anything to do with her. After this, there's less references to the Weird Route, at least while in the Sanctuary Dark Worlds. When Susie leaves to collect information about the notes to be played on the piano, Ralsei asks if Kris would like to think about what Susie's doing. If the Player refuses to think about her, an option is given to think about Noelle. When doing so, the Player views a small red pixel that, after floating and slightly glowing for a moment, says \"Thank you...\" in Noelle's voice. Upon returning to Kris, the Player finds Kris on the ground, likely having had a panic attack, Susie tending to them. Susie notices Ralsei wasn't there and scolds him upon returning. When Kris is confronted by the Old Man, asking them where to go, Kris can respond \"Nowhere\" to which he will mention that it sounds like they're having \"Relationship Trouble\". During the tea party, the Old Man will mention how Kris seems to just be going through the motions, and tries to help them keep their chin up, telling them that it'll all be better, before offering Kris an apple which they ravenously devour, even part of the core. After sealing the first Dark Fountain, when searching for the combination to the lock on the door to the inner sanctuary, they find a shelf for prayer candles. Susie asks who Kris will pray for as they light a candle, and if the Player chooses \"Noelle\", Kris will kick the shelf violently. Later, when in the Choir chamber, Susie mentions about the piano and a story she had with one. Susie asks if Kris will keep playing the piano, and if the Player chooses \"I will never play again\", Kris will bite their own hand to stop the Player's words. In the Final Dark World, after Susie discovers and shatters the final prophecy, Ralsei breaks down into tears. If the Player tells Ralsei \"It's okay not to smile\", Ralsei will mention that if there is another path besides the one they're on, that it could possibly be worse. Finally, as the night comes to an end, the Fountains are sealed, and Kris returns home to find their mother dancing with Sans, Kris decides to go to bed early when they're called by Mayor Carol, who leaves a message, asking if Kris is going to the festival tomorrow, as Noelle really is looking forward to seeing them there. As the chapter comes to a close, we see an image of that once small, red pixel, having become far larger by comparison..."
